I think this entire project was very daunting at first. To be honest it was a bit of a challenge. Grid came a little easier to me than Flexbox but that doesn't dismiss how challenging it was to create the layout.

In my opinion, I could really clean up the code a lot more. I'm sure there's a lot of unnecessary css and html. I think I overdid it with the amount of grids that I used. However, seeing as this was my first project using grid and making a more complicated layout, I think I did pretty good :)
